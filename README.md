## REACT BASICS 

- React creates plain JS objects that describe DOM nodes and not updating the real DOM

- `ReactDOM.render()` -- renders react elements to the DOM.
    - Accepts:
        - React element/object to render 
        - Actual HTML element you want to update or render to.


- Any exisitng DOM elements inside the root dic will be replaced when render is called.

- REACT just manages what gets updated in the page via REACTDOM.render().


### JSX 

- Redudant createElement() is replaced by JSX.

- JSX is an extension to the JavaScript language that uses a markup-like syntax to create React elements. Most React developers write their UI using JSX because it resembles writing HTML.
